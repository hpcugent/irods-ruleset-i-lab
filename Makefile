# Makefile for building and installing the Utrecht University iRODS ruleset
#
# Please note the following:
#
# - To make use of the 'update' make target, this ruleset directory needs to
#   have a .git directory (i.e. you should clone this repository using git,
#   rather than download a source tarball).
#
# - The 'update' target simply does a git pull. Make sure to checkout the
#   correct branch for your environment first. That is, 'master' for a
#   production environment, 'release-*' for acceptance environments, and
#   'development' for dev/test environments.
#
# - For the 'install' make target to work, you should place this ruleset
#   directory in the folder 'iRODS/server/config/reConfigs'. Don't forget to
#   append the ruleset name ($RULESET_NAME minus the '.re' extension) to the
#   reRuleSet line in server/config/server.config.
#
# make update  - pull changes from git remote, updates .r files
# make install - install ruleset (concatenated .r files) into the parent directory

# Input files.

RULE_FILES ?= $(shell find . -type f -iname '*.r')

# Output files.

RULESET_NAME ?= rules-i-lab.re
RULESET_FILE := $(RULESET_NAME)

INSTALL_DIR  ?= ..
